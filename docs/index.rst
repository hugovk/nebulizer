Welcome to nebulizer's documentation!
=====================================

**Nebulizer is a Python utility which provides a high-level
interactive command-line interface to remotely administer
Galaxy servers.**

Nebulizer was developed as a tool to help "part-time" Galaxy
admins perform day-to-day administrative tasks across
multiple Galaxy instances. It enables admin operations to be
executed via the command line as an alternative to using
the Galaxy web interface.

Nebulizer is built on top of the
`Bioblend <https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
library and offers an interface and range of functionality that
complements the lower-level interfaces offered by
`Ephemeris <https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
and `Parsec <https://parsec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
