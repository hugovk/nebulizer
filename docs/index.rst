Welcome to nebulizer's documentation!
=====================================

**Nebulizer is a Python utility which provides a high-level
interactive command-line interface to remotely administer
Galaxy servers.**

It enables admin operations to be performed via the command
line, as an alternative to using a Galaxy instance's web
interface.

It was developed as a tool to help "part-time" Galaxy admins
perform day-to-day administrative tasks across multiple
Galaxy instances.

Nebulizer is built on top of Bioblend and complements the
more powerful but lower-level interfaces offered by Ephemeris
and Parsec.
